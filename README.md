# DoneIn60seconds
C# scripts for TabularEditor
This repository contains the C# macro scripts demonstrated in the Done in 60 Seconds session at New Stars of Data, held on May 16, 2025. The presentation showcases how automation in Tabular Editor can speed up common tasks when developing Power BI semantic models, in particular with respect to time intelligence.

A recording of the session will be available, providing context and guidance on how to use each script effectively.

The scripts can be used in the free open source version, Tabular Editor 2.

# Included in the scripts:
- MacroAction file containing all macros (MacroAction.json)
- Macros for creating time intelligence calculations
- Macros to import best practice rules and ensuring consistency and quality in the model

All macros are included in the MacroAction.json file. For individual file, only macros I have modified have been included.

It aims to cover common repetitive tasks, with macros that are dynamic an can be applied in every model.
